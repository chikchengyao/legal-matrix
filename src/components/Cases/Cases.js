                        Employer ended their employment contract without notice without paying them. Their employment
                        contract indicated that the employer needs to give 2 weeksâ€™ notice. This is in breach of s13(1)
                        of the Employment act.

                        Worker was afraid of being sent back to their country after employment contract ended, therefore
                        did not insist on staying to serve out the notice of their employment. Worker was afraid that it
                        would bring attention to their employment status if they argued with their employer
                    </p>
